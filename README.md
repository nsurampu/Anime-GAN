# Anime-GAN

A GAN implementation for generating anime character faces

The current implementation makes use of a Deep Convolution GAN (DCGAN) to learn and eventually generate pictures similar to anime character faces. The current implementation has been run for only 300 iterations due to various constrains and the results are as follows:

Initial generator image:

Generator image after 300 iterations

The results will become better as the GAN is passed through more iterations. The database for the GAN can be found [!]here.
