# Anime-GAN

A GAN implementation for generating anime character faces

The current implementation makes use of a **Deep Convolution GAN (DCGAN)** to learn and eventually generate pictures similar to anime character faces. The current implementation has been run for only 300 iterations due to various constraints and the results are as follows:

Initial generator image:

Generator image after 300 iterations
![Iters300](https://github.com/nsurampu/Anime-GAN/blob/master/STEP200.png)

The results will become better as the GAN is passed through more iterations. The database for the GAN can be found ![here](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/1Rq6HZzc3oUUcBOmJpooVtuFdfwddC-D_)
